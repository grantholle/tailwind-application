    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3 pt-2">Who I Am</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm a full-stack developer with 9 years of experience. My hometown is Springfield, Missouri, but I've been living in Tianjin, China for close to 6 years. If selected for this job my family and I would return back to the US. What an opportunity!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Tailwind CSS and Refactoring UI (and now Tailwind UI) have radically changed how I build user interfaces. I would love to be on the team that brings so much power, flexibility and speed to creating and mainting interfaces for thousands of developers just like me.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3">What I Bring</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">These are things that I can bring to the table:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
      <li><strong>A kid tested and mother approved stack.</strong> I love Laravel, Node and Vue. JavaScript rules. React is ok. Svelte is neat.</li>
      <li><strong>Tailwind experienced.</strong> I've been using Tailwind CSS in production apps for more than two years. I consider myself to be very fluent. The day I found it is still fresh in my mind (a story for another time).</li>
      <li><strong>Adept communicator.</strong> I'm used to working on a distributed team. My current position has me working with people in locations spanning the globe. I pride myself on my written, oral and [most importantly] <span class="fancy-underline" data-gif="https://media.giphy.com/media/qVTwEFNbRtUKQ/giphy.gif"><span>gif communication skills</span></span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Service oriented.</strong> I'm the only engineer in my organization. I have to support everything I build. I also maintain a few Node packages that I enjoy supporting and maintaining.</li>
      <li><strong>The <span class="line-through">devil</span> joy is in the details.</strong> Every pixel, alignment and color matter. A lot.</li>
      <li><strong>Always be learning.</strong> My ears and eyes are wide open ready to learn something new. I'm never afraid to say, "I don't know, but I can figure it out."</li>
      <li><strong>Passionate about the future.</strong> People are doing amazing things to take the web further and make it more accessible to everyone. I want to be on the frontlines.</li>
      <li><strong>A jolly Holle.</strong> I like to joke and have fun. I quote <span class="fancy-underline" data-gif="https://media.giphy.com/media/zCv1NuGumldXa/giphy.gif"><span>movies</span></span> and <span class="fancy-underline" data-gif="https://media.giphy.com/media/liBsVeLILcyaY/giphy.gif"><span>TV shows</span></span> often. Have I mentioned I like <span class="fancy-underline" data-gif="https://media.giphy.com/media/tItIlCGySM0ieKKW6b/giphy.gif"><span>gifs</span></span>?</li>
      <li><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work.</strong> The best ideas come about when you least expect them, often through a good conversation with a friend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-3 pt-2">Why I'm Applying</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">One of the big things I appreciate about Tailwind is the transparency of what you all are working on, the progress of your projects and your successes and failures along the way. I've learned a ton from Adam's screencasts and Steve's UI tips. My favorite newsletters to read were the ones leading up to the launch of Tailwind UI. Adam's details on the progress you all had made and some things you learned while building components were so insightful to me.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Things I'm looking forward accomplishing:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Being more community involvement.</strong> Being on the team would allow me to engage others in the community both from a support perspective and seeing the improvements that could be made from the suggestions of others.</li>
      <li><strong>Soaking up knowledge and wringing myself out.</strong> Having the opportunity to pair program with someone like Adam would be out of this world. I have so much more to learn from one of the greats and would love to share that knowledge with others.</li>
      <li><strong>Expanding Tailwind's horizons.</strong> Advancing adoption by adding integrations into more frameworks, tools and workflows.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">I will never <span class="italic">not</span> use Tailwind. Going back to writing individual CSS declarations for every single aspect of my UI is laughable to me now. I believe that I have what it takes to join the team and play a part in continuing the success of Tailwind for years to come.</p>
